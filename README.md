Your job is to build out the creative using your ES6/Javascript/Html/CSS abilities. This template uses the FF0000 Ad Tech framework, but you are welcome to author however you like.

More advanced applications/workflows can be integrated as needed. For example, Preact/React and/or other Javascript libraries & frameworks, Web Components, etc. Anything that Webpack can handle can be compiled.
